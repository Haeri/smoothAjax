smoothAjax
==========

This "plugin" allows for content to be loaded in with Ajax and adds an animation to make the load process look smooth.
JQuery is required to make this work.

to call the function you need to type:

smoothAjax(holder, loader, loadFrom, eq,  animHeight, animWidth, speed, callback, callback2);
